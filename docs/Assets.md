## WebP 
WebP is an image format developed by Google that provides superior compression and quality characteristics compared to JPEG and PNG.

Use WebP for photographic images or graphics with complex textures and gradients, especially when optimizing file size for web delivery

On other hand, SVG for graphics that can be represented with vector shapes, such as icons, logos, illustrations, and diagrams.

```js
import balance from "@assets/banners/balance.webp";
